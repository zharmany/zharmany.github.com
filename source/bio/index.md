Provided [student films][MyIMDb] are admissible, I have a [Bacon number][WikiBaconNumber] of 4. Also, due to my more successful [academic career][MyErdosNumber], I have an [Erdős number][WikiErdosNumber] of 3; I'm  quite happy of the resulting [Erdős-Bacon number][WikiErdosBaconNumber] of 7. 

I received the B.S. degree (magna cum laude, with honors) in electrical engineering and the B.S. degree (cum laude) in physics from The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2012. In 2010 I was a visiting researcher at The University of California, Merced, Merced, CA. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI. His research interests include nonlinear optimization, machine learning, and signal and image processing with applications in medical imaging, distributed computing, and night vision. Dr. Harmany is a member of IEEE, SIAM, and SPIE.
