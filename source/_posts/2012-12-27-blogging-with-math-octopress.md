1) Configuring Octopress for use with MathJax

2) Maruku more MathJax friendly processor (show example with ``\int_``, and compare to kramdown)

3) Offline draft editing, one option is to use the preview, but Marked offers a nice solution. How do we use kramdown with marked? Need script, and  need to set path.
